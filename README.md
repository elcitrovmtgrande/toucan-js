## Description
Toucan is a JS library that lets you create and manage JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). But we're not going to call it just JWT, that's too boring! Let's call it "JSON Web Toucan" instead. ðŸ¤£ This awesome library makes working with JWTs a piece of cake, whether you're on the client or server side.

Toucan is super lightweight and has a really simple and easy-to-use API. So, why stick to the old ways when you can fly high with Toucan? ðŸ¤©

## Installation
To install this amazing package, run the following command:

```bash
npm i jw-toucan
```

That's it, no need for small talk. You're ready to roll!

## Usage
To start using Toucan, just import it into your project:

```typescript
import Toucan from 'jw-toucan';
```

### Create a Toucan instance
You can create a new instance of Toucan from a JavaScript object as a data payload or directly from an existing JWT you've stored somewhere.

```typescript
const FromData = new Toucan({ id: 1, name: 'john' }, { expiresIn: 10 });

const FromJWT = new Toucan('eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwibmFtZSI6ImpvaG4iLCJpYXQiOjE2OTA4NDE0NTYsImV4cCI6MTY5MDg0NTA1Nn0.4m6mk7T8z0tuW18eV3WcaGgkeZa7FVTeIIIdOfvSZGA'); 

```
This is where Toucan shines! With just one method, you can create a new instance from a data payload or an existing JWT.

### Get the JWT or the data payload from the instance
Once you have your Toucan instance, you can easily get the JWT or the data payload.

```typescript
const MyToucan = new Toucan(payload: string | object, config: object);

MyToucan.getToken(); // returns the JWT
MyToucan.getPayload(); // returns the data payload
```
