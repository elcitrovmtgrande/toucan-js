## Description
Toucan is a JS library which allows you to create and manage JWT (JSON Web Token - <i>here know as a JSON Web Toucan looool </i>) the simplest way on both client and server side.

Toucan is also a very lighweight solution and its API is very simple to use.

Why wouldn't you change for Toucan ? ðŸ¤©

## Installation
To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
npm i toucan
```

Yes, no small talks, that's it.

## Usage
To use the package, you have to import it in your project:

```typescript
import Toucan from 'toucan';
```

### Create a Toucan instance
You can create a new instance of Toucan from a javascript object as a data payload or directly from an existing JWT you've stored somewhere.

```typescript
const FromData = new Toucan({ id: 1, name: 'john' }, { expiresIn: 10 });

const FromJWT = new Toucan('eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwibmFtZSI6ImpvaG4iLCJpYXQiOjE2OTA4NDE0NTYsImV4cCI6MTY5MDg0NTA1Nn0.4m6mk7T8z0tuW18eV3WcaGgkeZa7FVTeIIIdOfvSZGA'); 

```
This the main strength of Toucan. Only one method to create a new instance from a data payload or from an existing JWT.

### Get the JWT or the data payload from the instance
Then, you can use the instance to get the JWT or the data payload.

```typescript
const MyToucan = new Toucan(payload: string | object, config: object);

MyToucan.getToken(); // returns the JWT
MyToucan.getPayload(); // returns the data payload
```
